                            <p>Evolution took a long time to happen and even a longer time for humanity to accept it. A point of debate between conservatives and scientists for centuries, concerning its existence. Evolution was too slow for mankind ‘cos man wasn’t patient enough to observe the gradual changes happening around him. But evolution happened right in front of his eyes at a miraculous pace, not in sentient beings but in technology. Yes, the whole of technological evolution can be attributed to the last 20 years and it has come to the point where miracles in technology are typically not miracles anymore. <br> <br>

But even in this age of miracles, the technology which amazes us every time is IMAX. As their website promises, ‘full immersion’ and ‘maxing out the senses’ does happen. With the advent of it in Luxe Cinemas Chennai, it has become fairly popular with hardcore movie buffs. Though the audience number is dwindling due to the price hike in Multiplexes, it is still considered as a sacred space to watch movies.
<br> <br>

It all began when a small group of Canadian experimental filmmakers came together to produce a multi-screen film installation at EXPO ‘67 in Montreal. The installation was part of a competition to create the first truly large-screen film experience. The filmmakers did it by syncing nine projectors together. It was a huge technological challenge. And as they pulled it off, the ambitious team that would one day start the company to be known as IMAX was faced with another question: wasn’t there a better way? <br> <br>

The answer, of course, was yes – but there would be many challenges to overcome before getting there. Over the next three years, IMAX technology was born, and its epic camera, projector and domed screen system premiered at the Fuji Pavilion at EXPO ’70 in Osaka, Japan. <br> <br>

But what really is the difference? How closer are we to the virtual stories than in a normal theatre? What is the secret behind the enhanced immersive experience? Believe me, size of the screen is just the beginning. In this article, we bring you the technical know-how and the knowledge behind IMAX which makes it to stand out. <br> <br>

  <h5><strong>LASER PROJECTION TECHNOLOGY</strong></h5> <br> <br>

  The biggest difference is the twin projection system. Two projectors simultaneously work to give pristine images of the Digitally Remastered Version. IMAX boasts the world’s most technologically advanced and powerful projection.  IMAX LASER, which as the name suggests uses a high-powered laser light engine (rather than traditional xenon lamps) in each of its twin 4K proprietary digital projectors to light the huge screen sheet; thus providing audiences with the sharpest, brightest, clearest and most vivid on screen images ever. It is said that the projecting light can be seen from the moon! <br> <br>


  <h5><strong>SCREEN SIZE</strong></h5> <br> <br>

Bigger is most definitely better when it comes to experiencing the latest movie blockbusters, and there’s no screen bigger than theirs! IMAX hosts the world’s largest cinema screen and this unrivaled scale allows viewers to be transported right into the action. <br> <br>

<h5><strong>THEATER GEOMETRY</strong></h5> <br> <br>

IMAX is customised for each venue to achieve the right blend of Audio and Video Optimisation. Yes, each theater is planned and designed separately. This commitment makes sure the quality doesn’t drop. It’s not just the large screen that makes a difference, it’s the shape of the auditorium and how the seats are placed.  Many movie auditoriums are long and narrow, to get the most people in, with the screen way off at the far end.  The distinctive shape of an IMAX theater is designed to bring the audience not only closer to the screen, but better-positioned in relation to it.  The result is an image that’s wider and higher than your field of view, giving you the feeling you’re part of the action – not just watching it. <br> <br>

<h5><strong>DIGITAL REMASTERING</strong></h5> <br> <br>

Due to the unique nature and the high optimisation levels of the presentation, Digital Remastering is mandatory.  As sensational as the image out of the projector is, it can be limited by the quality of the content going into it. The secret sauce in the IMAX mix is DMR – or Digital Re-mastering – a transformative proprietary process that turns an already powerful movie into a breath taking IMAX blockbuster with unparalleled image and sound quality. IMAX spends months on location and in the editing room with the director and technical teams of each film – meticulously adjusting the saturation, contrast, brightness and hundreds of details in virtually every frame in order to present the movie at its best. <br> <br>

<h5><strong>IMAX AUDIO</strong></h5> <br> <br>

A surprisingly large part of the IMAX experience is the sound.  That’s what makes an IMAX movie visceral. You don’t just see a movie in IMAX, you feel it in your bones. One reason is the sheer power of the custom, patented fully immersive 12.1 channel 15,000 watt digital speaker system in an IMAX theater. Another is the wider frequency response – which means higher highs and lows so low they’re as much vibrations as sounds. The customised theater geometry also plays its part here as sound is also affected by the room in which the listener sits and as such the theater is designed as much around the sound output as the on-screen visuals. <br> <br>

<h5><strong>IMAX 3D</strong></h5> <br> <br>

IMAX is a quantum leap ahead when it comes to 3D visuals. The difference between IMAX 3D and regular 3D is as vast as the difference between an IMAX movie and an ordinary one.  3D requires two images – one for the left eye and one for the right eye – to be projected onto the screen at the same time. Whereas most multiplex cinemas utilise one projector to do this, alternating the projection of each eye’s image, IMAX uses two projectors – one dedicated to each eye, ensuring unsurpassed brightness and clarity. Almost all 3D cinemas in multiplexes are compromised in their design, as they are retrofitted 2D cinemas.  IMAX is designed and purpose built as a 3D theater from the outset, ensuring only the highest quality 3D experience no matter where you’re seated. <br> <br>

Popular perception among people especially in Chennai is that IMAX is a money grabbing hoax. Something which is glorified and does not make much of a difference. But the disheartening thing is people don’t give it a chance. The experience need to be felt to be given an opinion. A lot of effort is taken to bring the movies to IMAX including the fact that a special IMAX camera is required. The editing and remastering processes are slow and exhausting to say the least. IMAX is the next giant leap in Cinema, make sure you don’t get left behind.
